### Data Flow
1. **Account creation** – when a teacher (or admin) creates a student record the system
   only stores basic credentials in the `students` collection.  An example document
   might look like:

   ```json
   {
     "_id": "642f6a...",
     "name": "Niket",
     "enroll": "12345678901",
     "password": "$2b$10$yVuX...",
     "verify": false,
     "isDeleted": false,
     "createdAt": "2026-02-28T14:14:30.028Z",
     "updatedAt": "2026-02-28T14:14:30.028Z",
     "__v": 0
   }
   ```
   
   This record is purely for authentication and verification status.  Profile fields
   such as address, marks, etc. are not stored here.

   At this point there is *no blockchain data* involved; the student may later
   log in and complete the full profile.

2. **Student fills profile form** – when the student submits the profile, the
   backend stores the raw values in a temporary `studentforms` collection (plain
   Mongo document).  This allows teachers to review the full profile in clear
   text before approving it.  Only after a teacher verifies the record does the
   server encrypt the data and transfer it into the `studentprofiles` collection
   (our blockchain store).

   Plain form documents (before verification) look like:

   ```json
   {
     "_id": "642f8c...",
     "studentId": "642f6a...",
     "name": "Niket",
     "enroll": "12345678901",
     "branch": "Computer",
     "year": "2nd Year",
     "dob": "2004-05-01",
     "gender": "Male",
     "phone": "9876543210",
     "email": "nik@gmail.com",
     "address": "...",
     "fatherName": "...",
     "motherName": "...",
     "parentPhone": "...",
     "sem1": "80",
     "sem2": "82",
     "sem3": "79",
     "sem4": "85",
     "sem5": "90",
     "sem6": "",
     "photo": "abc123.jpg",
     "status": "pending",
     "createdAt": "2026-02-28T15:00:00Z",
     "updatedAt": "2026-02-28T15:00:00Z",
     "__v": 0
   }
   ```

   Example block document created on verification:

   ```json
   {
     "_id": "642f7b...",
     "studentId": "642f6a...",        // reference back to students collection
     "hash": "3f1c5e...",            // AES-encrypted JSON string
     "previousHash": "0",            // blockchain-style pointer
     "blockNumber": 1,
     "__v": 0
   }
   ```

   At this stage the student’s profile is locked (`isProfileLocked` toggled when
   the response returns) and the only place the profile data lives is inside the
   encrypted `hash` field.  **Teacher verification is a separate step that does
   not move or duplicate this block – it only updates the `verify` flag on the
   original `students` document.**

3. **Teacher review & verification** – teachers load pending students via
   `/student/pending`, view the decrypted profile (pulled from the blockchain
   block), and choose to verify or reject.  Verifying simply sets `verify: true`
   on the original `students` document – the encrypted block remains unchanged.
   The system therefore keeps a clear separation between the **normal**
   credential record and the **immutable blockchain record**.

4. **Post‑verification** – once verified a student’s dashboard and teacher
   panel reflect the `verify` flag, and subsequent requests (e.g. admin queries)
   can filter on that field.  All future profile data is still referenced by the
   original block number; no data is “moved” between collections, but the
   verification status ties the two together.

### Student Workflow
1. **Login** → Navigate to Student Dashboard
2. **Complete Profile** → Fill all fields from 4 sections + Upload photo
3. **Submit Profile** → Profile saved and locked on blockchain
4. **Teacher Verification** → Teacher views and marks record verified

---

## 🚀 Deployment Guide

### Deploy Backend (Node.js)
1. Push code to GitHub
2. Connect to Railway.app or Heroku
3. Set environment variables: `MONGO_URI`, `JWT_SECRET`, `PORT`
4. Deploy with `npm start`

### Deploy Frontend (React)
1. Build optimized production bundle: `npm run build`
2. Deploy to Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages
3. Update API base URL to production backend
4. Deploy and verify routes work correctly

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Cannot find module" errors**
- Solution: Run `npm install` in both BackEnd and BlockChain directories

**MongoDB connection failed**
- Solution: Check `MONGO_URI` in `.env` file, verify MongoDB is running

**Profile shows encrypted on frontend**
- Solution: Ensure backend decryption endpoint is called, verify JWT token is valid

**Image upload fails**
- Solution: Check file size limits in `multer` config (middleware/upload.js), verify destination folder exists

**Verification status not updating**
- Solution: Refresh page or clear localStorage, verify teacher endpoint returned success
